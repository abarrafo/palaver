        <div class="content-for-copying">Red Eye. Jetblue Flight 7201?</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">OK. We've contacted JetBlue, law enforcement and Apple too.</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Good news! Flight crew found it. However, it's on its way back to LA. Don't worry, we will have it couriered to you first thing tomorrow AM.</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Whew! Wow! Thx!</div>
        <h3>Lost Response</h3>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Great question. You're talking about _event protection_. You have some liability protection under your _homeowners_, but depending on the details you may want additional protection for the day. For starters, how many guests?</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">OK. Assuming you'll be serving alcohol plus you have a pool. I recommend opting for a 12-hour event protection. And I also suggest _umbrella_ for upping your overall protection regardless.</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Time?</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Noon to midnight.</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Great, thanks!</div>

        <div class="content-for-copying">Hi Steve. Just a quick reminder that your travel insurance for your Biz trip to Atlanta is set to kick in at 7AM tomorrow. You're covered through Thursday at 10PM when you return.</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">Good question. There's weather disrupting flights on the Eastern Seaboard today. Tomorrow should be fine, but I might suggest tarmac insurance if you are concerned about potential delays.</div>
        <div class="content-for-copying">OK. Yes, I see you added a rental just now. Remember that you are covered under your Amex, so no need to buy extra. Also remember that once you park your car at Logan, the coverage goes to sleep.Â </div>
